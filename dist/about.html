          <h3>Character artist</h3>
          <h5>Level: Intermediate</h5>
          <p>
            I am new at this field of art, a year ago I can only draw Stickman
            which is not really a bad drawing style but I think it’s time to be
            better and chase my dream as a professional 3d character game
            artist. So I have followed lots of online tutorials and also taken
            classes at school to develop my skills. There are some of my works
            in my portfolio, feel free to have a look.

          <h5>Level: Intermediate</h5>
          <p>
            At first, the only thing that I want is just drawing characters, but
            after having some range of knowledge in drawing character and also
            being inspired by many awesome digital drawings on internet and also
            various mediums paintings. I decided to land a foot in this area to
            have some experience.There are some of my works in my portfolio,
            feel free to have a look.

          <h3>Graphic designer</h3>
          <h5>Level: Elementary</h5>
          <p>
            This is not my major but i also have lots of interest in it. I have
            learnt art theory and graphic designing in university for nearly 2
            years, thus I have some ranges of experience in this field but not
            too confident to say I’m on high level. But I’m willing to achieve
            more experience in this interesting art field.There are some of my
            works in my portfolio, feel free to have a look.
